### Classifier_challenge

### Goals
To compare different kind of machine learning classifier with eachother on the diabetes dataset
-> KNN, logistic regression, SVM, Random Forest Trees
(logistic regression with added higher order features)
(automatised parameter searching on the SVM with random search)
(logistic regression with bagging & adaboost)
(random forest trees with adaboost & gradient boosting & XGBoost)

### Results
- The random forest trees where the most accurate , knn also did really well.
- The bagging and boosting on the logistic regression had a positive effect
