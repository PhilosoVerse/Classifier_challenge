# Classifier_challenge

Goals
- to compare different kind of machine learning classifier with eachother on the same dataset (diabetes-dataset) -> KNN, logistic regression, SVM, Random Forest Trees
(i also tried to do logistic regression with added higher order features)
(i also tried to automatise the parameter searching on the SVM with random search)
(i also tried logistic regression with bagging & adaboost)
(i also tried random forest trees with adaboost & gradient boosting & XGBoost)

Results ->
the random forest trees where the most accurate , knn also did really well.
